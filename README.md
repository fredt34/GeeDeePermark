# GeeDeePerMark

The privacy watermark.

## Goal

Provide a simple API to have images watermarked with a given text - So People Don't Ever Have To Send Their Unprotected ID Documents.

## Definition

### Accepts:

- image and pdf
- text (default: "Confidential")
- text-size: 1, 2, 3, or 4 (default: 3)

### Returns:

- watermarked image

All process runs in memory - no image is ever stored

## Security of your documents

## Logs

## Language

Python. Has lots of libraries, secure and easy to install & read. Shamelessly vibe-coded with VSCode, Cline and free Grok-AI.

Program should be as short as possible - ideally, only 1 single file, in order to be extremely easy to install and run.

This can't work in CloudFlare Workers - so , self-hosting was necessary.

Plus, it always fun to learn new techs ðŸ˜ƒ.
