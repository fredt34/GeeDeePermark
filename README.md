# GeeDeePerMark

The privacy watermark

## Goal

Provide a simple API to have images watermarked with a given text.

## Definition

Accepts: 
  - image and pdf
  - text
  - text-size: 1, 2, 3, or 4

Returns:
  - watermarked image

All process runs in memory - no image is ever stored

# Language

To be determined.

Program should be as short as possible - ideally, only 1 single file, in order to be extremely easy to install and run.

# Available on

geedeepermark.cpvo.org

This can't work in CloudFlare Workers - so , self-hosting.

# Sources

Inspired by https://filigrane.beta.gouv.fr/, but this tool has no API
